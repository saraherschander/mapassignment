	This September, NYC launched its new Learning Bridges initiative, designed to provide childcare for the city's essential workers and most vulnerable families in light of an uncertain 2020-2021 school year. Yet the rollout has been far from equitable.
<br>
<br>
	"The [COVID-19] crisis is compounded by the dearth of affordable childcare. The  absense of affordable child care leaves families with young children facing significant strain to maintain stable epmloyment or re-enter the workforce," said Jennifer March, Executive Director of Citizens' Committee for Children (CCC).  
<br>
<br>
	A study from the CCC found that only <a href="https://www.cccnewyork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NYCs-Child-Care-Affordability-Crisis.pdf">1% of families</a> in Elmhurst and Corona can afford private center-based childcare and only 6% could afford home-based care. With zero Learning Bridges centers located in Elmhurst, Corona, or neighboring Jackson Heights, working families in Central Queens have no close options for childcare.
<br>
<br>
	They're not alone. Queens has by far the fewest Learning Bridges locations per capita in New York City, with 40, 247 people per location.
